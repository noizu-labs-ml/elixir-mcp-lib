# Transport Layer

## Overview

Transports are split into two behaviours: server-side sinks (`Noizu.MCP.Transport` — write-only, message-level) and client-side transports (`Noizu.MCP.Transport.Client` — bidirectional, owns the connection).

## Server transports (sinks)

Server transports implement `send_message/3` to write encoded JSON-RPC to the wire. The Session holds a `{module, state}` sink tuple.

### Stdio (`Transport.Stdio`)

Reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC from stdin, writes to stdout. Creates one implicit session at startup. Logger output is diverted to stderr to avoid corrupting the protocol stream.

### Streamable HTTP (`Transport.StreamableHTTP.Plug`)

A Plug handling POST/GET/DELETE on a single MCP endpoint:

- **POST** — JSON-RPC request/notification. `initialize` creates a session and returns `Mcp-Session-Id`. Responses are `application/json` unless progress/logging flows, which upgrades to SSE.
- **GET** — Opens the general SSE stream for server→client notifications. Supports `Last-Event-ID` resumability via `EventStore`.
- **DELETE** — Terminates the session.

Origin validation guards against DNS-rebinding (configurable: `:localhost`, `:any`, or allowlist).

### Test (`Transport.Test`)

In-process message passing for tests. No serialization overhead, but messages cross the encode/decode boundary for fidelity.

### VFS transports (`Transport.VFS.Socket` / `VFS.WS`)

Carry `vfs/*` extension ops to local mount clients: length-prefixed JSON-RPC over a unix domain socket (`VFS.Socket`), or WebSocket via `GET /vfs` upgrade (`VFS.WS`).

## Client transports

Client transports implement `start_link/2`, `send_message/3`, and `close/1`. They deliver inbound messages to the owning `Noizu.MCP.Client` GenServer.

### Stdio.Client (`Transport.Stdio.Client`)

Spawns an MCP server as a subprocess via Erlang Port. Sends newline-delimited JSON-RPC to stdin, reads from stdout. Subprocess stderr is inherited.

### StreamableHTTP.Client (`Transport.StreamableHTTP.Client`)

Req-based HTTP client. POSTs each outbound message; handles both JSON and SSE responses. Maintains the `Mcp-Session-Id` header. Opens a long-lived GET stream for unsolicited server→client traffic. Supports auth strategies via the `Auth.ClientStrategy` behaviour.

### Test.Client (`Transport.Test.Client`)

Connects a Client to a Server in the same VM via direct message passing.

### VFS.Client (`Transport.VFS.Client`)

Elixir client for the VFS unix-socket transport.

## SSE codec (`Transport.SSE`)

Shared encoder/decoder for Server-Sent Events. Used by both the Streamable HTTP Plug (server-side encoding) and the StreamableHTTP.Client (client-side incremental parsing).

## EventStore

`Noizu.MCP.Server.EventStore` is a bounded per-session ETS ring buffer (default 1000 events) that backs `Last-Event-ID` resumability for Streamable HTTP. Node-local; multi-node deployments need sticky sessions or a custom store.

**Disconnect survival** — the outbound Sink routes each message: (1) the SSE stream of the causative request (`related_request_id`), else (2) the session's GET stream, else (3) buffered in the EventStore. The message is appended to the EventStore in every case, so chunks emitted while the client is disconnected are never lost — the next GET (or a reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`) replays them. Closing a session closes GET connections and drops the buffer.
